CSV Samples:
These samples are here to allow for better developer testing
(and to provide some decent samples for anyone looking to implement their own CSV feeds)

SQL cleanup script:
There is also a cleanup sql script which is for testing purposes only and will clean out all the CM tables
(effectively resetting the system to the state it was in before any feeds were processed).
